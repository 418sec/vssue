# Introduction

Vssue is a __Vue__ component / plugin, which can enable comments for your static pages.

As your pages are "static", you don't have database nor backend APIs, but you still want users to login and post comments. With the help of OAuth API of the code hosting platforms (e.g. Github, Gitlab, Bitbucket, Coding, etc.), Vssue can help users to login with account of those platforms, and store the comments in their __Issue__ System.

This is how __Vssue__ get its name : __Vue__-powered and __Issue__-based.

## How it works

## Comparation with similar projects

__Vssue__ is inspired by [__Gitment__](https://github.com/imsun/gitment) and [__Gitalk__](https://github.com/gitalk/gitalk), with some differences:

- __Vssue__ supports Github, Gitlab and Bitbucket. __Gitment__ and __Gitalk__ only support Github.
- __Vssue__ is based on [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org). __Gitment__ is based on vanilla javascript, and __Gitalk__ is based on [Preact](https://github.com/developit/preact).
