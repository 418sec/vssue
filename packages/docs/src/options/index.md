# Options Reference

## Vssue Options

Vssue Options (type `VssueOptions`) is set when calling `Vue.use()`:

```js
import Vue from 'vue'
import Vssue from 'vssue'

Vue.use(Vssue, {
  // Vssue Options
})
```

### api

- __Type__: `VssueAPIContructor`
- __Details__:

  The constructor of the API class that implements `VssueAPI` interface.

  Vssue will use it to create an API instance, and use the API instance to send requests to platform.

  The name of Vssue's API packages format as `@vssue/api-${platform}-${version}`, for different API version of different platforms.

  Currently, we provide following API packages:

  - Github
    - API V3: `@vssue/api-github-v3`
  - Gitlab
    - API V4: `@vssue/api-gitlab-v4`
  - Bitbucket
    - API V2: `@vssue/api-bitbucket-v2`

- __Example__:

  ```js
  import Vue from 'vue'
  import Vssue from 'vssue'
  import GithubV3 from '@vssue/api-github-v3'

  Vue.use(Vssue, {
    api: GithubV3,
    // Other Vssue Options
  })
  ```

  ::: tip
  In fact, the platform itself is "opaque" to Vssue. Vssue just loads comments via the API instance, and does not care about what the platform is and what the version of API is. This is how Vssue supports different platforms.

  So it is easy to support new platforms / new version of API by creating new API packages.

### owner

- __Type__: `string`
- __Details__:

  The owner's name of repository to store the issues and comments. Could be the name of a __user__ or an organization (__Github Organization__ / __Gitlab Group__ / __Bitbucket Team__).

  Together with `repo`, Vssue could locate the repository on the platform.

- __Reference__: [repo](#repo)

### repo

- __Type__: `string`
- __Details__:

  The name of repository to store the issues and comments.

  Together with `owner`, Vssue could locate the repository on the platform.

- __Reference__: [owner](#owner)

::: tip
The common pattern of repository's URL is `` `${baseURL}/${owner}/${repo}`  ``:

- Github: `https://github.com/${owner}/${repo}`
- Gitlab: `https://gitlab.com/${owner}/${repo}`
- Bitbucket: `https://bitbucket.org/${owner}/${repo}`
:::

### clientId

- __Type__: `string`
- __Details__:

  The `client_id` intoduced in [OAuth2 spec](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6749#section-2.3.1).

  It is the client identifier that issued by the platform. You will get it after you set up OAuth App.

  Vssue will use it together with `clientSecret` to get user's access token.

- __Reference__: [Set up OAuth App](../guide/supported-platforms.md), [clientSecret](#clientsecret)

### clientSecret

- __Type__: `string`
- __Details__:

  The `client_secret` intoduced in [OAuth2 spec](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6749#section-2.3.1).

  It is the client secret that generated by the platform. You will get it after you set up OAuth App.

  Vssue will use it together with `clientId` to get user's access token.

- __Reference__: [Set up OAuth App](../guide/supported-platforms.md), [clientId](#clientid)

::: tip
In different platforms, the actual name of __OAuth App__, `clientId` and `clientSecret` differs:

- Github: __OAuth App__, __Client ID__ and __Client Secret__
- Gitlab: __Application__, __Application ID__ and __Secret__
- Bitbucket: __OAuth consumer__, __Key__ and __Secret__
:::

### baseURL

- __Type__: `string`
- __Default__: `undefined` (according to the platform)
- __Details__:

  This is the base URL of your platform.

  Default values for supported platforms are:

  - `'https://github.com'` for Github
  - `'https://gitlab.com'` for Gitlab
  - `'https://bitbucket.org'` for Bitbucket

  ::: warning ATTENSION
  Only when you choose to use __self-hosted Gitlab__ should you set this option.

- __Reference__: [Gitlab Application](../guide/gitlab.md)

### state

- __Type__: `string`
- __Default__: `'Vssue'`
- __Details__:

  The `state` element introduced in [OAuth2 spec](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6749#section-4.1.1).
  
  Vssue will send it with OAuth redirection and check if it is matched in callback.

  It's designed for preventing [CSRF](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6749#section-10.12), but it's not so useful here as we put everything in a static page. So just ignore it or set it to anything you like.

### labels

- __Type__: `string`
- __Default__: `'Vssue'`
- __Details__:

  To set the labels of issues that Vssue uses. Accepts a __comma-separated__ string.

  If you want to set multiple labels, separate them by comma. For example, `'Vssue,Comments'` means to have both `'Vssue'` and `'Comments'` labels.

  Vssue will only request those issues with the labels and ignore others. Together with `title`, `labels` will help to identify the corresponding issue of Vssue.

  ::: tip
  Bitbucket does not support issue labels for now, so this option will be ignored if you are using Bitbucket.
  :::

- __Reference__: [title](#title)

### prefix

- __Type__: `string`
- __Default__: `'[Vssue]'`
- __Details__:

  The title prefix for issues. Used for generating the actual title of the corresponding issue.

  For example, if the `prefix` is `'[Vssue]'` and the `title` is `'Vssue Demo'`, the actual title of the corresponding issue is `'[Vssue]Vssue Demo'`.

  It will be ignored if the type of `title` is `Function`.

- __Reference__: [title](#title)

### admins

- __Type__: `Array<string>`
- __Default__: `[]`
- __Details__:

  Array of username that has admin access to Vssue. The `owner` always has admin access.

  Only `admins` can auto create corresponding issue if it does not exist.

  ::: tip
  If you want to auto create the issue when the `owner` is a organization rather than a user, you can add your username into `admins`.
  :::

- __Reference__: [owner](#owner)

## Component Props

### title

- __Type__: `string | (options: VssueOptions) => string`
- __Required__: `false`
- __Default__: `document.title`
- __Details__:

  The title of issue that used by this Vssue component.

  - If the type is `string`, the actual title of issue is `` `${prefix}${title}` ``.
  - If the type is `Function`, the actual title of issue is the return value of the function. Notice that the first parameter of the function is the options of Vssue, and you can use them to generate the actual title.

  ::: warning ATTENSION
  When trying to load comments, Vssue will request for the corresponding issue according to `labels` and `title`. If the issue does not exist, Vssue will try to create one.

  In other words, `labels` and `title` is the identifier of the corresponding issue.
  
  So make sure that Vssue on different pages have different `title`s. Vssue with same `title` will correspond to the same issue, and share the same comments.
  :::

- __Reference__: [prefix](#prefix), [labels](#labels)

### options

- __Type__: `Object` (`VssueOptions`)
- __Required__: `false`
- __Default__: `{}`
- __Details__:

  The properties in prop `options` will override those set by `Vue.use()`. Accepts all the properties in `VssueOptions`.

  You can take the options set by `Vue.use()` as __global__ / __default__ options, and take the prop `options` as __local__ options.
