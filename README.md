## Inspiration

__Vssue__ is inspired by [__Gitment__](https://github.com/imsun/gitment) and [__Gitalk__](https://github.com/gitalk/gitalk), with some differences:

- __Vssue__ supports Github, Gitlab and Bitbucket. __Gitment__ and __Gitalk__ only support Github.
- __Vssue__ is based on [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org). __Gitment__ is based on vanilla javascript, and __Gitalk__ is based on [Preact](https://github.com/developit/preact).

## Supported Platforms

- GitHub
- GitLab (v11.0+)
- BitBucket
  - No reactions and labels support
